•But don’t forget(!): CBM has a cost too!
•The benefits in each case must be (reliably) quantified and compared to the 
initial and running costs of the CBM system 15.80 15.80 0.30 0.30
Vibration / Acceleration
Emitted by all moving machinery
Transmission in solids at speed of 
sound 
Immediate response to changes
Encodes a high amount of 
information (for instance on the 
origin of a parasitic vibration based 
on characteristic spectrum)Temperature
Changes as a result of unwanted 
vibrations and friction
Transmission in solids via thermal 
conductivity
Slow response to changes
Can encode less information (heat is 
caused by any part of the machine)Measurands Encoding Information About Moving Machinery

Summary and Outlook
26.06.2023 © 2023 Kistler Group     kistler.com 21•Safety, reliability, ecological compatibility and availability to be fulfilled with 
lower costs Motivation
•CBM is a chance to realize this and always requires measuring systems The role of CBM
•Getting the entire system of systems to work (sensors, mounting, data 
acquisition, edge and cloud computing, proper visualization) The challenges
•Kistler developed a POC ORMS with inputs from AVA, capable of showing 
wheel health and track -wheel interactions with accelerometer data Turning data into value
•Converting a meaningless acceleration signal into interpretable information 
about the assets being monitoredThe special role of 
visualization
•New use -cases, data pipeline and GUI for live visualization Outlook
